## React Boilerplate
_Personal Note: Remember to press ctrl+shift+m in your atom editor for a live markdown preview_

### Overview
This project is a barebones boilerplate for front-end web development heavily
based on Kriasoft's [React Starter Kit](https://www.reactstarterkit.com).
As such, it is also built on top of Facebook's
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) library and
[Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) architecture, and uses
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + [Express](http://expressjs.com/) as the local
development server. It also leverages modern web development tools such as
[Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) and
[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/).

### Purpose
The main purpose of this project is for the author to learn how to setup a
professional-level front-end web development environment that fits his personal
ethos and philosophy in terms of software engineering. Hopefully, the results
can also be used for the author's projects in a way that quality, reliability,
and maintainability is at the forefront.

<!-- Perhaps add a demo in the future! -->
